# Introduction

## What is Object oriented programming?

**Object oriented programming** is a programming methodology where the individual components are created around **objects** that deal with data (also known as the state) and behaviour (via methods).

## What are the features of OOPs?

- **Encapsulation**: self contained modules that bind the data and the methods that can process the data.
- **Inheritence**: allows the arrangement of components(classes, interface, etc.) in hierarchical order which result in sharing of data and behaviour from parent to child classes.
- **Polymorphism**: it litteraly means "many forms". Using polymorphism, we can define one contract (say an interface method) and can provide its multiple implementations which can be resolved at runtime depending on the obejct being used.

## What is a class?

A class is a template that defines the data (attributes) and behaviors (the methods via which we can act upon the data).

## What is an object?

An object is a runtime instance of a class. A class can thus be instantiated multiple times and all the resultant objects will be different each having their own state.
